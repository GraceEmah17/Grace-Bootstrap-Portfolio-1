Projects

This week challenge was for me to create a bootstrap portfolio project from scratch. A bio webpage about myself using jumbotron, also pictures of myself. I created this using html for the structure of the portfolio web page and css to style it, in addtion, i used mobile css, font-awesome, fonts. 
Ensuring the page looks like the mockup for the for challenge which was given, including the images and sizes.

This project was about a marketing company that wanted to make their webpage better by ensuring site is optimized for search engines. This was achieved by making sure i gave the it an identity for it to be clickable. A short discription of all images were added to using an alt atribte to it. 
The technologies used for this project was html and css to style the page.
